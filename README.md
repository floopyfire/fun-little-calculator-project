# fun little calculator project
## features
#### there isn't much to do with this project, the most you're going to get is:
#### <b>1.</b> addition
#### <b>2.</b> subtraction
#### <b>3.</b> multiplication
#### <b>4.</b> division (with and without remainder)
#### <b>5.</b> exponentiation
#### <b>6.</b> roots (any, really)
#### <b>7.</b> factorialization
## how to use
#### make sure you have the latest version of python installed.
#### just install the operators and calculator file, make sure you place them on only one folder, otherwise im afraid it wont work.
#### i recommend opening the file with vscode, as that's the program i used to code the file.
### i probably will check on this page every once in a while, but dont expect me to fix every single bug in 2 hours. also, i know the code can be simplified but i really dont care
